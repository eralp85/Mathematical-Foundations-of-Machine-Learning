    "## Basis Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Basis Vectors are set of vectors that can be scaled to represent any vector in a given vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "We typically use unit vectors along the axes of a vector space for basis vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* So if we have a two dimentional vector space, we can represent it with two axes X and Y and the typical basis vectors would be unit vectors along X and Y axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Orthogonal Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Orthogonal vectors are sets of vectors where we have a two dimensional space and we take the dot product of those two vectors, X and Y, and we get zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "What that meeans that thes two vectors are at 90 degrees to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Orthonormal Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Orthonormal vectors are orthogonal vectors that are also unit vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basis vectors are always orthogonal to each other, but they are not always unit vectors.\n"
